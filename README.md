## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging the power of Excel and Power BI to clean, explore, visualize, and analyze revenue data for the year 2011. We've specifically looked at revenue generated by the top 10 customers, top 10 countries, and revenue on a monthly basis. Additionally, we've delved into unit purchases based on the countries of customers.
